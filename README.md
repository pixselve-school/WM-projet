This project provides a web Front-end made with Angular for managing associations services provided by a [REST API](https://github.com/pixselve-school/tp1-wm). 
The user interfaces provide all tools you need to interact with, edit and display data from the API.

## âœ¨ How to use

We released a Docker image for anyone to use. It is available
on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/pixselve-school/tp1-wm/pkgs/container/tp1-wm).

```bash
docker run -p 4200:4200 ghcr.io/pixselve-school/wm-projet:main
```

Or use a `docker-compose.yml` file:

You can find a complete docker compose file including the frontend and backend, a RabbitMQ instance, a PostgreSQL and a
